# Regression test for GitHub #45 — "Compilation error statically linking erpl-web extension".
#
# When erpl_web is consumed as a dependency (duckdb_extension_load / FetchContent), only the
# extension source is fetched; the `duckdb` git submodule is NOT. But test/cpp includes
# catch.hpp / core_functions_extension.hpp via paths relative to that submodule
# (../../duckdb/...), so building the C++ test target in a consumer tree fails with
# "catch.hpp file not found". DuckDB's BUILD_UNITTESTS does not distinguish the two cases
# (it is TRUE in both our dev build and a consumer's main DuckDB build), so CMakeLists.txt
# must gate add_subdirectory(test) on the in-tree submodule's presence.
#
# This is a pure-CMake script — no DuckDB configure required — so it runs identically on
# Linux, macOS and Windows.
#
# Run with:  cmake -DREPO_DIR=<repo root> -P test/cmake/test_cpp_tests_guard.cmake
