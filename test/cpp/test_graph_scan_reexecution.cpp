// Per-execution scan state for the Microsoft Graph SharePoint and Excel readers, and for
// the ATTACHed SharePoint list scan - the #75 class, reported as GitHub #202.
//
// Every one of these functions kept its scan cursor - the parsed yyjson document, the
// array iterator over it, and a `done` flag - on the BIND DATA, which DuckDB reuses
// across executions of a bound plan. Worse, the parse step cleared the buffered response
// as it consumed it, so a second execution had nothing left to re-parse either. The
// second EXECUTE returned zero rows, with no error.
//
// The cursor now lives on GraphJsonArrayScanState (and ExcelRangeScanState for
// graph_excel_range), both GlobalTableFunctionState, created fresh per execution.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES AND DOES NOT COVER
//
// GraphClient::BaseUrl() is a hardcoded https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0 with no
// override, so - unlike Business Central, whose `environment` may already be a URL -
// these functions cannot be driven against the loopback ODataTestServer without adding a
// new base-URL escape hatch. Such a hatch decides where an OAuth bearer token is sent and
// is a security change well beyond the scope of a state-lifetime fix, so it is not made
// here.
//
// So this file asserts the structural property the fix consists of: every Graph scan
// function declares an init_global, which is the ONLY way a DuckDB scan can hold
// per-execution state. A function whose cursor is back on the bind data has no
// init_global to declare. This is not a substitute for an end-to-end test, but it is
// falsifiable and it is driven by a name table, so a new Graph reader must be added to it
// - an agent-crew review found excel_table_scan missed by the first cut of this fix
// precisely because nothing asserted the wiring. It is paired with direct coverage of the
// state objects themselves below. The full end-to-end re-execution behaviour is covered
// against a real server for the readers that can reach one
// (test_odata_scan_reexecution, test_microsoft_scan_reexecution,
// test_delta_share_scan_reexecution).
//
// Note on the include set: Catalog::GetEntry<TableFunctionCatalogEntry> odr-uses that
// entry type's static `Name`, which the linker then reports as duplicated against
// libduckdb_static.a. The untemplated GetEntry plus Cast<> avoids that and is why the
// lookup below is written the long way.
