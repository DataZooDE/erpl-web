"""Smoke test for erpl_web DuckDB extension.

Downloads the official DuckDB CLI for the specified version and architecture
from GitHub releases, then verifies the built extension artifact loads and can
make a real outbound HTTP request. Simulates exactly what a user does after
downloading the extension from the distribution channel.

Usage: python3 scripts/smoke_test.py <extension_path> <duckdb_version> <arch>

  extension_path  Absolute path to the .duckdb_extension file to test
  duckdb_version  DuckDB version tag, e.g. v1.5.1
  arch            Target architecture: linux_amd64 | osx_amd64 | osx_arm64 | windows_amd64

# The smoke test answers one question: does the freshly-built extension binary
# load into the official DuckDB CLI and can it issue a real outbound HTTP
# request? It does NOT validate httpbin.org's uptime.
#
# Two independent checks, because they fail for different reasons:
#   1. LOAD_SQL  — the extension binary loads cleanly. This is the critical
#      signal: a broken/ABI-mismatched artifact fails here and MUST fail CI.
#   2. HTTP_SQL  — http_get reaches an external endpoint. httpbin.org is the
#      project's standard test endpoint but is frequently rate-limited or
#      returns 5xx; when it is unavailable that is not a fault of the
#      extension, so we retry and ultimately tolerate httpbin-side errors.
#
# Note: we intentionally skip duckdb_extensions() here. On GitHub Actions
# Linux runners (not in Docker), querying duckdb_extensions() after loading
# this extension triggers a SIGSEGV inside DuckDB's runner security sandbox.
# LOAD success + an attempted http_get is the meaningful signal.
